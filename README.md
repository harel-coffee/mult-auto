# Multiple Learning Training (MuLT) Approach

MuLT aims at employing unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised learning algorithms to create different data representation in a try to improve classification performance.

## Experiments

This repository contains a broad set of experiments using The [Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass data set](https://research.themmrf.org/).

Our experiments cover the following topics:

   0. Data cleaning and preparation;
   1. Modelling of FISH markers from gene expression levels;
   2. Compute of accuracy gain by adding genes to clinical predictors;
   3. Definition of Treatment Sensitivity (TS) outcome from treatment response;
   4. Modelling of TS from genes, clinical markers, and treatments;
   5. Structure analyses of genes and clinical markers; and
   6. Simulation of optimal treatments from TS predictors.

> **_Note:_** All *.ipynb files correspond to the topics number bellow. To reproduce experiments just run *.ipynb files following numeric order.

## Publication

At this moment, the paper named **_"Machine learning predicts treatment sensitivity in multiple myeloma based on molecular and clinical information coupled with drug response"_** describing all motivations and experiments related to this repository was submmited to the **[Bioinformatics Journal](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics)**.
